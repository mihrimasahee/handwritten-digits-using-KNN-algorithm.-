# handwritten-digits-using-KNN-algorithm.-
classify handwritten digits using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 
This notebook demonstrates the process of loading, visualizing, and classifying handwritten digits using the KNN algorithm. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the KNN algorithm is implemented to classify the digits. The accuracy of the algorithm is calculated and displayed, and the test images are visualized along with their predicted labels.
